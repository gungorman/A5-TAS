## FID is a method that calculates the distance between distribution of datapoints.
## Since out data is high dimensional, for each time step, one feature of each trajectory will be taking
## This will result in distributions of real and synthetic data, one for each datapoint and feature
## Finally, the FID is calculated for each of these distributions, obtaining a FID score in time for each feature
